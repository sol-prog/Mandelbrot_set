## Compilation
---
In order to compile on your machine you'll need FreeImage installed. The code was tested with the latest stable Clang (from Xcode 4.6) and GCC 4.7.2. 

If you have a Ubuntu (version 12.10 comes with GCC 4.7.2) machine with GCC 4.7.2 and libfreeimage-dev installed, you can compile the code with:

    g++ -std=c++11 -O3 save_image.cpp utils.cpp mandel.cpp -lfreeimage

If you use Ubuntu 12.04, the default GCC is 4.6.x. You can still compile the code by **commenting** any line that uses the &lt;chrono&gt; header, you need to do this only in mandel.cpp. You can compile the code with:



    g++ -std=c++0x save_image.cpp utils.cpp mandel.cpp -lfreeimage

For OS X (Xcode 4.6 with command line tools and FreeImage installed) you could use:

    clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ save_image.cpp utils.cpp mandel.cpp -lfreeimage
